<p>Draw on a sheet of paper the speech waveform for the English word /mask/ as uttered by an adult male speaker. Use a scale of approximately 1cm=10ms. Mark clearly the beginning and ending of various phonemes in the word (/m/,/a/,/s/ and /k/). Also mark regions of silence using symbol [sil]. Clearly show the difference in amplitude of various sounds. What changes would you make if the speaker were to be a female or a child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record the speech signal for the word /mask/ and compare or verify with the waveform you sketched in Assessment #1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sketch the waveforms for the following words and write down the main differences:</p>

<li>
<p>Write a small program in C or any scripting language (bash, csh, awk, perl, python, etc) to convert a given text stream of word-level transcription into a stream of syllables and phonemes. Assume that the input stream of word-level transcription uses ITRANS code. In the output stream use space for word boundaries, '-' for syllable boundaries, and '_' for phoneme boundaries.</p>
