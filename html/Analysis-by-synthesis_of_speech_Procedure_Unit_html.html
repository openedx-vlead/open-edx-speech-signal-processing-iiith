<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose any of the pre-recorded speech signals and load them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study the characteristics of generated LP residual signal. This residual is generated using a LP order of 11 and will be used to synthesize the speech signal in further stages of experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose from the drop down menu, type of excitation signal that would be used to synthesize the speech signal. Also choose the order of LP coefficients to be used to synthesize the speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the 'Synthesize' button to synthesize speech signal according to the parameters chosen. Study the characteristics of the re synthesised speech by using different excitation types, namely, LP residual, impulse excitation and random noise excitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study the effect of using the vocal tract system derived using different LP orders for resynthesis. Zoom into the waveform to study different regions of synthesized waveform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat the experiment for sentences recorded with your own voice.</p>
