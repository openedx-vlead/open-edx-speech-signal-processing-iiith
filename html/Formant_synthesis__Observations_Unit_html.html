<li>
<p>There is a direct correspondence between a set of formant frequencies and a vowel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The synthesized vowel gives a perception of the expected vowel, except for the loss of naturalness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loss of naturalness is mainly due to the approximation of the speech production mechanism by a source-system model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system is approximated as an all-pole system which is reasonable for vowel sounds which do not have significant anti-resonances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The excitation source represented by a train of impulses is not a good approximation and better models of excitation are required to gain naturalness.</p>
