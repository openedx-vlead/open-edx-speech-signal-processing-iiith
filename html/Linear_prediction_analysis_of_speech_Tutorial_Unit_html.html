<h3>Source-system modeling of speech signals using LP analysis</h3>
<p>The vocal tract system can be modeled as a time-varying all-pole filter using segmental analysis. The segmental analysis corresponds to the processing of speech as short (10-30 ms) overlapped (5-15 ms) windows. The vocal tract system is assumed to be stationary within the window and is modeled as an all-pole filter of order \( p \) using linear prediction (LP) analysis. The LP analysis works on the principle that a sample value in a correlated, stationary sequence can be predicted as a linear weighted sum of the past few (\( p \)) samples. If \( s(n) \) denotes a sequence of speech samples, then the predicted value at the time instant \( n \) is given by $$ \hat{s}(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{p}{a_k~s(n-k)} \qquad (1) $$ where \( \{a_k\},~k=1,2,...,p \) is the set of linear predictor coefficients (LPC) and \(p\) is the order of the LP filter. The error at time \(n\) and the sum of squared errors \( E \) are given by $$ r(n)~=~s(n)~-~\hat{s}(n) \qquad(2)$$ $$ E=~\sum_{n}{r^2(n)} \qquad(3) $$ The cost function \( E \) is minimized with respect to \( \{a_i\},~i=1,2,...,p \) over the interval \( {-\infty}~{\leq}~n~{\leq}~{\infty} \) (autocorrelation formulation) as, $$ {\partial{E}}/{\partial{a_i}}~=~0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1~{\leq}~i~{\leq}~p \qquad(4)$$ This minimization leads to a set of normal equations, $$ \sum_{k=1}^{p}{a_k~R(i-k)} = -R(i)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1~{\leq}~i~{\leq}~p \qquad(5)$$ where $$ R(i) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}s(n)~s(n+i)~~~~~~~~~~-{\infty}~{\leq}~i~{\leq}~{\infty} \qquad(6) $$ is the autocorrelation sequence. The solution of these normal equations gives the values of the predictor coefficients \( \{a_k\},~k=1,2,...,p \). The error signal \( r(n) \) obtained by inverse filtering the speech signal is referred to as the LP <i>residual</i>. The smooth variations (highly correlated) in the speech signal are captured by the LPCs and are attributed to the vocal tract characteristics. The complex poles of the LP filter occur as conjugate pairs, and each pair represents a resonator cavity, with a maximum response at a frequency (called as <i>resonant frequency</i>) where the poles are located on the z-plane. The vocal tract can be considered as a cascade of resonator cavities with different shapes and sizes. The resonant frequencies of these cavities are referred to as <i>formants</i>. The LP residual signal has large error values at regular intervals and can be attributed to the periodic impulses of excitation. Hence the LP residual is a good approximation to the excitation source signal and can be used further to extract the excitation source characteristics. A segment of voiced speech (windowed), frequency response of the inverse filter and the corresponding LP residual are shown in Figure 1.</p>

<h2>Short time spectrum, LP spectrum and Inverse spectrum</h2>
<p>The short-time spectrum consists of range of frequencies (magnitude and phase components) that are present in a small segment (10-30 ms) of a signal. An inverse spectrum \(A(j\omega)\) is an all-zero model derived from \(A(z)\). The LP spectrum is an all-pole model given by \(\frac{1}{A(j\omega)}\). The LP spectrum can approximate the envelope of the short-time spectrum depending on the choice of LP order. The gross envelope is captured at low LP orders such as 1 or 3. The short-time spectral envelope is finely matched as the LP order increases. One of the main issues in LP analysis is the choice of appropriate LP order. Figures 2 and 3 show the short-time spectrum, LP spectrum and the inverse LP spectrum for a segment of voiced (/a/) and unvoiced speech (/s/) respectively.</p>
