<p><b>Part-1: Acoustic-Phonetic Labeling (pre-labeled examples)</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Select one of the prelabeled examples from the drop down box. Click on the go button.</li>
<li>By repeatedly zooming in and listening to different segments of the speech waveform identify regions of voiced/unvoiced/plosive/silence. Observe the time-varying nature of the waveform from one region to the other.</li>
<li>Select the correct excitation type, manner of articulation (MoA) and place of articulation (PoA) for each of the phonemes listed in the table.</li>
<li>Click on the phoneme symbol (first column of the table) to zoom fit to the presegmented label, and observe the signal characteristics.</li>
<li>Write a brief note on the observations.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><b>Part-2: Acoustic-Phonetic labeling without feedback </b></p>
<ol>
<li>Write down a sentence of your choice in one of the chosen languages.</li>
<li>Record the sentence you chose in the previous step.</li>
<li>Observe the signal characteristics of differents phones in the sentence and choose the appropriate excitation type, MoA and PoA for each phoneme.</li>
<li>Repeat the experiment by recording different sentences covering different categories of sound units.</li>
</ol>
