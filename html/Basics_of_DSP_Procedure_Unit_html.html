<h2>Part 1: Aliasing and quantization effect</h2>
<h3>1-A: Sampling and aliasing</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select one of the sample .wav files provided and click on the load button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the play button. Listen carefully to the quality of the signal, in terms of perceived background noise/distortion and clarity or intelligibility of the sounds/message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the sampling frequency to 8000 Hz and listen to the utterance. Perceive the change in quality of speech between 16 kHz and 8 kHz, by repeatedly switching between 16 kHz and 8 kHz.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listen to the utterance at 4 kHz, 2 kHz, and 1 kHz. Observe the degradation in quality as the sampling rate is reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat the experiment with the anti-aliasing flag checked. Do you perceive any change in distortion between with and without anti-aliasing? Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat the experiment for a recording of your own voice.</p>
