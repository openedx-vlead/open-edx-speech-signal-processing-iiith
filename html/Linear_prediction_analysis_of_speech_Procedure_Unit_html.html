<ul>
<li>
<p>Select one of the provided speech utterances and click on the load button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a short segment (20-50 ms) of voiced speech (say a vowel), using 'Zoom to selection' button, and compute the short-time and LP spectrum by clicking on the spectrum button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The windowed signal, the log spectrum and the LP log spectrum are displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the LP order from the default value 1, to values provided in the drop down box. Click on the spectrum button to recompute the spectra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe that the LP log spectrum approximates the short-time spectral envelope (i.e., the formants) better with increases LP order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the LP order is increased to a very large value, say 40, the LP spectrum tries to approximate the short-time spectral envelope more closely thereby approximating peaks due to pitch harmonics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study the effect of pre-emphasis flag on the LP spectrum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compute the LP residual signal for different LP orders by clicking on the residual button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The correlations in the input segment of speech can be seen to be gradually removed in the LP residual signal as the LP order is increased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The LP residual signal for an LP order of 10 or above removes most of the correlations in the input signal, and the resulting signal looks like a train of impulses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat the experiment by selecting an unvoiced segment of speech, say a fricative /s/.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a brief note on the observations.</p>
