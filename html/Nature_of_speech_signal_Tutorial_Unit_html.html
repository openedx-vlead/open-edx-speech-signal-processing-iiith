<li>
<p>The quasi-periodic nature of prominent peaks shown in Figure 2 is due to the regular vibration of the vocal folds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pitch period (\(T_{0}\)) is measured as the interval between any two successive prominent peaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speech signal between two successive prominent peaks corresponds to one pitch cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note the time (in msec) of the pitch period for three or four pitch cycles (say) and measure the average pitch period, preferably in the steady portion of the speech signal as illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As pitch period is not constant over the entire vowel segment, make four or five pitch period measurements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mean of these values gives average pitch period (\(T_{0}\)) and hence fundamental frequency (\(F_{0} = \frac{1}{T_{0}}\)).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Average pitch period can also be obtained from the autocorrelation sequence of corresponding speech segments. Measure the distance between the peak at zero and the next prominent peak in either the positive or negative delays of the obtained autocorrelation sequence.</p>

<p>The peaks of the LP spectrum shown in Figure 3 represent the resonant frequencies (also called Formants) of the vocal tract.</p>
