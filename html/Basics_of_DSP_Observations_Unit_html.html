<p>The quality of speech is directly proportional to the number of quantization levels ( that is, number of bits used for quantization).Though quantization results in loss of information the human perception mechanism can still get the information present in the speech signal. </p>

<li>
<p>It is interesting to note that even with 1 bit/sample, most of the speech is intelligible. Hence we can conclude that significant information lies in the phase sequence of the signal, even if the amplitude information is destroyed.</p>

<li>
<p>The aliasing effect is perceived as distortions in the output signal. This is due to the effect of overlapping of frequency components.</p>

<li>
<p>As radius \(r_i\) (magnitude of pole) approaches to 1, the bandwidth decreases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The increase in bandwidth results in more damping of the impulse response.</p>
